Subject Documentation
=====================

The purpose of this document is to identify information about the subject
which could be relevant to validity of the results. For example, if a student
is highly apprehensive of failing in front of the instructor, they may hold
themselves back, even though their solution is correct. Thus their progress
may be impeded compared to a student who enjoys the challenge of a difficult
problem and is not deterred by failure.

When I try to solve a problem, I expect to succeed
I have been programming over 4 hours a week for (amt of time)
I am eager to learn
When given a challenge, I often need it explained
It is difficult to build a solution on top of other code when I don't understand how it works
It is difficult to take pieces of code that I understand, and combine them to solve larger problems
When I get stuck on a problem, I (rank them in order)
  ask another student
  ask an instructor
  search the internet
  read documentation
  read the source code
  try things that seem like they might work
  explore the problem using a tool like Pry or Seeing Is Believing
When I find a solution to a problem, I usually remember how to do it
I need a tool to be explained to me before I feel comfortable using it
When I learn that a new tool exists, I feel

When I see syntax that I do not understand
  I can usually figure out what it does
  I can't make sense of the code
  A little of each
When it comes to typing speed and keyboard shortcuts
