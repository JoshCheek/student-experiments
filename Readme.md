Student Experiments
===================

This is a repository for experiments that I run on students.
It's not a super formal science in that it would be difficult
to reproduce the experiments exactly, and there's rarely
a single variable that can be analyzed.
But I typically have hypotheses and will amend constraints
partway through.

It's also intended to help me identify what types of pedagogical techniques
are effective in which ways. I was very mediocre as a teacher for a long time,
and it was really the [The Little Book of Talent](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Talent-Improving-Skills/dp/034553025X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427229939&sr=8-1&keywords=the+little+book+of+talent)
which got me to re-evaluate my approaches.
On the whole, I see less value in the struggle than I used to.

I could talk for a bit about what my goals are, but my brain is a bit fragmented at the moment,
so I'll leave that to another day.
