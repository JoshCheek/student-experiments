From the time we're small, we hear this good advice from our parents and teachers:
Take it a little bit at a time. This advice works because it accurately reflects
the way our brains learn. Every skill is built out of smaller pieces -- what scientists call chunks.

Chunks are to skill what letters of the alphabet are to language.
Alone, each is nearly useless, but when combined into bigger chunks (words),
and when those chunks are combined into still bigger things (sentences, paragraphs),
they can build something complex and beautiful.

To begin chunking, first engrave the blueprint of the skill on your mind (see Tip #2).
Then ask yourself:

1) What is the smallest single element of this skill that I can master?
2) What other chunks link to that chunk?

Practice one chunk by itself until you've mastered it --
then connect more chunks, one by one, exactly as you would
combine letters to form a word. Then combine those chunks
into still bigger chunks. And so on.

Musicians at Meadowmount cut apart musical scores with
scissors and put the pieces in a hat, then pull each
section out at random. Then, after the chunks are learned separately,
they start combining them in the correct order,
like so many buzzle pieces. "It works because the students
aren't just playing the music on autopilot -- they're thinking,"
says one of the school's violin instructors, Skye Carman.

No matter what skill you set out to learn,
the pattern is always the same: See the whole thing.
Break it down to its simplest elements. Put it back together. Repeat.
