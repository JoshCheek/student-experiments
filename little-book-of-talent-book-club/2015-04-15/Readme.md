To run: `ruby to_html.rb bookclub_dsl.rb`

Third time I've done this one.
It was similar to the others, but we did it remotely

I feel like the remote thing makes it harder,
b/c I can't see faces.

Also changed it in that I showed them my solution as they were getting underway.
I'm not sure if this was good or bad. They got to a good solution much quicker,
but I did have to spend some time telling them to stop trying to copy mine.
It seemed to cause them to lose the vision of their domain,
and instead be trying to work from the glimpse that I gave them of mine.
But, in the end, they made some good decisions,
and I really liked what they came up with.

I spent the last 15 minutes taking the solution we'd come up with,
and building out some of the pieces beneath it,
so they could see it get all the way through and generate some actual HTML.

On the whole, I think it went well :)

It would be nice to have some sort of reiterative material they could go through.
I don't know what that would look like. Maybe a list of hypothetical situations,
with some possible ways to move forward, they would then have to choose the one that makes
sense according to the ideas presented here. This would help them define the idea
by juxtaposing it with some other reasonable possibilities.
